Only a small fraction of the increased costs is due to renewables. He is right in pointing out that the gas plants were overbuilt in Ontario and that has also added to increased costs. But the bottom line is, a renewables policy well implemented over time, as costs go down, is in fact the cheapest option for Ontario. Also, he is also misleadingly quoting peak period electricity costs, not average electricity costs, which are comparable to U.S. electricity costs.</td>\n",

       "146248   I dearly wish the most offensive and the most dangerous thing about Mr. Trump was the brand of gum he chews.  Unfortunately, as documented by years of his actions and comments and, especially, his ongoing actions and comments, Mr. Trump has presented and continues to present himself as the most unfit (unfit intellectually, unfit morally, unstable emotionally and IMO would be diagnosed as a sociopath) candidate for President in our history.  He's not just a \"loose cannon\", he's an extremely flawed \"loose cannon.\"  \\n\\nIf you feel my concerns are delusional, please study his personal history, study his business history, read his comments over the years, review the videos of his actions, watch his acceptance speech at the RNC, listen to the critiques of those who have worked with him. view his interviews,  even those with extremely sympathetic Fox News anchors, and decide for yourself.  I'm hardly in a position to cause us to \"lose our country.\"  Elected President, Trump would be..... Gary  \n",

Pence's oath and his office require him to serve the United States; his performance thus far has been as lackey to and enabler of Donald Trump. Trump is disgracing the office of president; in a different way, Pence is disgracing the office of vice-president.  \n",

In DC, for example, they've had to keep adding bikes and kiosks ongoing as usage keeps increasing.  And that's a city where ridership does drop during the cold months.  \\n\\nThis seems like a natural for Honolulu, where the monthly passes will be favored by local commuters and the tourists will pay the $3.50 per half-hour without swallowing hard.  I've been biking for years and have a lighter-weight bike set up just as I like it, but for the average short ride, these rentals have proven to get the job done very nicely.  My prediction is that it'll be a winner here.  \n",

       "1477825           I am a straight Catholic woman living in community with two gay women, one of them also Catholic. We are all professionals with more than a hundred years of service to the community between us. I know nothing of their \"bedroom activities\", as Tom Z sums up their identity as gay women. They are not interested in having anyone know anything about their \"bedroom activities\". Asked about their lives, they speak of the essential work they do in the community (we are a social worker, a doctor and a lawyer) and the loving home life that fills and heals their hearts and souls, allowing them to serve the community the next day. For people like Tom Z, they announce their \"bedroom activities\" when they introduce themselves as a family. For me, when they identify themselves as a loving family committed to serving the community, they announce the beauty of family and the shared joy of serving the community, EVEN the people who reject them. They are the most Christian, generous women I know.  \n",

If he cared to check his facts, he would know that the increase in costs for electricity in Ontario are largely due to three factors: Nuclear plant refurbishment and maintenance costs, electrical grid rehabilitation (long overdue before it was started and absolutely necessary), and inflation. Only a small fraction of the increased costs is due to renewables. He is right in pointing out that the gas plants were overbuilt in Ontario and that has also added to increased costs. But the bottom line is, a renewables policy well implemented over time, as costs go down, is in fact the cheapest option for Ontario. Also, he is also misleadingly quoting peak period electricity costs, not average electricity costs, which are comparable to U.S. electricity costs.  \n",

       "668223    \"as mere laity\"!!! You have it wrong. The Church is made up of all it's baptised people and not just the clerics. Looks at the facts. The Church has 1 male  Pope, 70 odd male  Cardinals, some 45 thousand male clerics and 1.2 billion laity. The clerics are just equivalent to an all-male club who arose as an elitist group in the time of the Byzantine Emperors, some 1650 years ago, who used them to administer an empire and gave them privileges far beyond their original purpose. The Church clerics have clung onto those privileges ever since and continually advanced their own cause of elitist, narcissistic clericalism. Are you telling me that some 45,000 clerics have more wisdom  and a greater sense of what is right and wrong than the baptised 1.2 billion Catholics? The Clergy seek only to protect, preserve and ensure the wealth,  dominance and dogmatic elitist \"club\". The early Church of Christ was a different deal where the slave, poor,  widow, merchant and elder each had their equal say.  \n",

Buses running in dedicated lanes on all of the main arterials, and a few rail lines where it makes sense. The traffic lights can be programmed to make sure the buses never have to stop anywhere except the stations. I'm not against cars, but they become problematic in urban areas since they just don't scale well. If highway demand doubles, the highway width must be doubled, costing hundreds of millions and requiring extensive ROW acquisitions. If demand along a bus line doubles, well, you just run the buses ever 5 minutes instead of every 10. Problem solved. We'll still need cars to get around in general, but for commuting, when everyone needs to get somewhere at the same time, transit can't be beat.  \n",
